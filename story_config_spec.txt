Each character story file contains a large list of story beats each separated by "---" (3 dashes) on a new line.

Each story beat consists of:
- id: The String id of the beat
- ascci: The ascci art to be displayed for the beat
- text: The text to be displayed below the ascci art
- actions: The actions the user can take and the next associated beat id 

Each property name is followed by a colon and the value for the property begins on the next line.
If the value goes onto multiple lines, the value end is marked with a "@" (at symbol).

The file should follow this general format:
id:
ID_VALUE_HERE
ascci:
ASCCI_ART_HERE

TEXT_VALUE_HERE

actoions:
